# my-Tasks-web

This is the frontend module of the `my-Tasks` project, a small _to-do_ App for creating and tracking tasks and managing their status (_To Do_, _In Progress_, _Completed_).

The `my-Tasks` project hast two modules (repositories:

- `my-Tasks-web` (**this module/ repository**): the frontend project, a so called _Single Page App (SPA)_ build with [Vite and the _react-ts_ template](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project), to be deployed to [Amazong S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html).
- [`my-Tasks-api`](https://github.com/pawsaw/my-tasks-api): the _RESTful api_, providing an endpoint for managing tasks (CRUD operations). This module is to be deployed to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) with [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) in a proxy configuration. The data is stored and managed in [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

A live demo version is deployed to: http://my-tickets-web-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tasks

## Configuration

### local development

1. Clone the project and install its dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pawsaw/my-tasks-web.git
cd my-tasks-web
npm install
```

2. Configure the base url of the `my-Tasks-api` project. You might want to store this value in your local `.env` file:

```yml
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://5rr3o0vvq1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

3. Develop in Vites incremental watch mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Deployment to _Amazon S3_

### Sign in to AWS

Sign in through the _AWS Command Line Interface_, as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html).

Hint:
Go to `IAM` in [AWS Console](https://eu-north-1.signin.aws.amazon.com/) to create access keys and than type into the terminal:
```sh
% aws configure    
AWS Access Key ID [****************QWIX]: 
AWS Secret Access Key [****************yrcD]: 
Default region name [eu-north-1]: 
Default output format [None]: 
````

### Build the distribution

```sh
npm run build
```

### Deploy to _Amazon S3_

```sh
npm run aws:deploy
```

A session typicaly looks like this:
```sh
% npm run aws:deploy

> my-tasks-web@0.0.0 aws:deploy
> serverless client deploy
